        Instructions

    <p>
        In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously with another
        participant. You will go for a hunt together. Each of you has the
        choice of hunting a stag or a hare. If you choose to hunt a stag, you
        can only  succeed with the cooperation of the other participant. You
        can get a hare by yourself, but a hare is worth less than a stag.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each of you must independently and simultaneously make a decision.
        Your payoffs will be determined by both choices as shown below:

            In each cell, the amount (in points) to the left is the payoff
            for you and to the right for the other participant.
